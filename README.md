This  project is based of an assessment requires you to create, test, and deploy, a proof-of-concept data-driven full stack web-application. The application should help make sense of existing data set(s) or solve a problem in your work or social life.
If you choose the former, you could scrape data, use data from a society or workplace, or find one or more data sets from Kaggle.
If you are solving a life/work problem, you may have noticed an ineffective process that needs to be improved or digitized.
